Ever  since  the  Federal  Archeology  Program  took  over  this  site          progress  has  been  slower  than  molasses  on  a  winter  Monday!
I  been  tryna'  tell  'em  the  Foddy  Resort  would  be  enough  like              originally  planned.  But a'course  those  white  coats  don't  listen  a  bit.
Almost  as  if  they  never  cared  about  making  a  resort  all  the               way  out  here  in  the  first  place.  Makes  ya  wonder...
No!  Dangit,  Richie.  Can't  become  a  conspirator  fearist  now.              What  would  Kyle  think  of  ya?
Hooooooo  boy!~  You  might  just  be  the  most  impressive  little              lady  this  side  of  the  globe!
That  was  so  dynamite  I  might  just  give  hiking  a  try!
Right  after  I  put  in  my  time  for  a  vacation,  anywho.
Happy  trails,  little missy!
...  what's  that?  You  say  your  name's  not  little  missy?
Liz?  What  a  great  name!

Maybe  dad  was  right.
Maybe  I  should  just  take  the  money  I'm  getting  from  this  job              and  be  thankful.
It's  not  like  we've  actually  had  to  do  any  real  work  in  months.
And  with  the  leftover  freetime  I  could  probably  work on  my              hobbies  instead  of  just  laying  here...
Dad...
I'm  gonna  start  working  hard  at  my side-hussle  just  cuz  of  you!
You're  something  real  special!
Come  and  visit  me  sometime  and  I'll  make  you  some  free                        cookies!
At  K's  Pastry  Building!
... hm.  That  name  could  use  some  work  though.

Sometimes  I  wonder  if  all  there  is  to  do  is  just  sit  here  on  this         mountain.
Obviously  it's  my  job  to-  what  with  being  a  fungus  and  all.
But  isn't  there  more  to  life  than  just  sitting  around  here                 because  I  was  told  that's  what  mushrooms  do?
Am  I  really  meant  to  work  until  I  can't  anymore?
Guess  I  was  meant  to  stay  here...
Guess  I  can  go  wherever  I  want!

I  could  never  get  any  rest  when  those  construction  workers               used  to  come  up  here.
Well.  Good  riddance,  I  say.
Discourse  is  only  good  for  chronically  online  people.
Why  try  to  be  around  other  people  at  all  if  all  they're  gonna  do  is  cause  trouble?
This  is  why  I  don't  interact  with  others...
You're  pretty  incredible.  Nice  climb.
And  your  dedication  to  your  craft  makes  me  think  not  all  strife  is  bad  strife.
Sometimes  we  just  need  a  little  room  to  grow.

Games  today  are  such  trash.  All  AAA  bigwigs  care  about  is              "sales  number  get  big  go  up  bigger  number  better  person  xD"
I  bet  that  they  only  ever  think  about  their  bottom  line.
Never  once  think  about  "will  this  microtransaction  make  our              game  better?  O.O"  Only  ever  "maybe  we  can  add  more  fan              service  or  cosmetics  and  they'll  ignore  the  shitty  model.  :3"
Swear  the  industry's  gone  to  shit.
Told  you  the  industry  is  shit.
Man...
Maybe  things  aren't  so  bad.
Maybe  *every*  game  doesn't  need  to  be  "good"  for  *some*  games              to  be  good.
Like.  Just  because  I  think  all  corporations  are  shills  and  evil              doesn't  mean  there  can't  be  honest  developers.
You  helped  me  see  that  by  finishing  your  climb.
Thanks  for  that. :3

When  I  close  my  eyes...  Nothing  seems  to  matter.
Should  I  gamble  with  my  life?
Maybe  this  time...  I  won't  be  alright...
Maybe  this  time...
I  wanna  live.  I  don't  wanna  die.
Sincerely,  I  think  you  feel  what  I  was  feeling!
Can't  you  see  your  life  so  clearly?
Now,  I  know  it  doesn't  last...
But  do  you  really  mind?
Just  face  your  fears  and  everything  will  turn  out  alright.

Ah.  Another  hiker.  Seems  like  you  made  it  up  here  just  fine.
I'm  pretty  sure  you  and  I  are  the  only  two  who've  ever  made  it  this  high.
I  mean.  I  guess  other  than  whoever  installed  that  elevator.
Probably  whoever  was  trying  to  make  a  hotel  here?  I  don't                          know.
There's  only  a  bit  left  to  go.
I  know  we've  only  just  met  but...  I've  never  finished  a  climb              before.  Think  you  could  make  it  to  the  top?  For  the  both  of  us?
Pretty  stupid  of  me,  huh?  Starting  with  the  tallest  climb  on              Earth?  Well.  I  guess  I  just  wanted  people  to  remember  me              for  something  amazing...
I'm  even  the  one  that  put  up  all  of  those  swing  ropes  leading  to  the  summit.  That  is,  of  course,  before  I  slipped  and  rolled  back                         down  here.
Hahaha... "c'est  la  vie"  and  whatnot.
I'm  sure  it's  been  a  long  way  for  you.
And  I  don't  just  mean  on  this  mountain.
Whatever  you're  doing  here...
However  you  got  here:
I  hope  you  find  what  you're  looking  for.
You  find  what  you  were  looking  for?..
Woah!  That's  an  incredible  find!  Somebody  else  was  here  before  us??
... that  look  in  your  eyes  makes  me  think  it's  not  actually  what  you came  here  for, though.
Like  you're  remembering  something  bittersweet.  Something  that  you  feel  you  can't  let  go  of?
But  to  be  honest,  I'm  glad  you  found  it.  Something  to  show  for  your  efforts!
Are  you  sad  that  your  journey  is  coming  to  an  end?
I'd  say  that  this  means  you  can  move  forward,  though.  With              sheer  and  utter  confidence,  no  less.
If  you  overcame  this,  what's  stopping  you  from  living  your  life              now?
You  can  do  anything.

Get  on  with  it.
We  have  much  to  do.  Let's  be  off.

Good  luck  with  whatever  you  choose.
I  know  why  you  came  here.
It  would  not  have  worked  the  way  you  wanted  it  to,  my  love.
Fate  can  be  cruel,  but  our  desparation  is  crueler.
Thank  you  for  choosing  to  honor  us.  Thank  you  for  choosing  to                      remember  us.
Take  your  time.  I'm  ready  whenever  you  are,  Elisia.
I  would  have  done  the  same  thing  given  the  circumstances.
